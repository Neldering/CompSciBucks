/*
A bowling team consists of five people.
 Each person bowls three games. 
 Write a Java program that uses a nested 
 loop to enter each playerâ€™s individual score and stores 
 this information in a file. Write a second program to 
 open the file, compute the average score for each bowler, 
 and print the information in table format.
